# CMSI 186 Lab 2 Virtual Darts Starter Code

This repository contains some unfinished Java programs that you will complete.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and copy the starter code to your repository according to the lab [instructions](http://volosin.lmu.build/alissa-volosin/cmsi-186-programming-lab/cmsi-186-assignments/assignment-02/). 

Use the provided test scripts.

In your new repository, donâ€™t forget to edit this README file, as _your_ repository will certainly not contain any unfinished Java programs.
